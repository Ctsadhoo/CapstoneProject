The Foursquare API was viable in the last assignment to analyze the postal codes, venues and neighborhoods of the Toronto area. We will scrape the dataset in order to complete the capstone assignment based on different criteria. I will use a radius of 300 meters as opposed to 500 that was intially used in my previous code. \n",
